# Throttling in JavaScript

## Definition

**Throttling** is a technique used to limit how often a function can execute over time.  
It ensures that a function is only called **once per specified interval**, regardless of how many times it's triggered during that time.

> Throttling is useful for optimizing performance in scenarios like scroll, resize, or rapid click events.

## Throttle Function Implementation

```javascript
function throttle(fn, delay = 1000) {
  let prev = 0;
  return function (...args) {
    let current = Date.now();

    if (current - prev > delay) {
      prev = current;
      fn(...args);
    }
  };
}
```

---

## Example Usage

```javascript
const log = () => console.log("called");

const throttledLog = throttle(log, 2000);

// Simulate rapid calls
throttledLog(); // Executes immediately
throttledLog(); // Ignored
throttledLog(); // Ignored
setTimeout(throttledLog, 2500); // Executes after 2.5s
```

---

## Step-by-Step Execution

1. When `throttledLog()` is first called:
   - `prev` is 0.
   - `current - prev` is greater than 2000ms.
   - `fn()` executes and `prev` is updated to the current timestamp.

2. If called again within the next 2000ms:
   - `current - prev` is less than `delay`.
   - Function is **not** executed.

3. After 2000ms has passed:
   - `current - prev` exceeds `delay`.
   - Function is allowed to run again.

## Visual Timeline

```
Time (ms)     : 0     500   1000   1500   2000   2500   3000
Calls         : ────────●──────●──────●──────●──────●──────●
Execution     : ●                          ●
```

> Only the first and the call after 2000ms delay will be executed.

---

## Use Cases

- **Scroll Events**: Avoid frequent calls while scrolling.
- **Window Resize**: Prevent layout recalculations from firing continuously.
- **Click Events**: Block multiple submissions or actions from rapid clicks.

---

## Summary

- Throttle ensures a **fixed interval** between function executions.
- Only one execution is allowed per `delay` period, no matter how many times the function is called.

```javascript
const throttledClick = throttle(() => {
  console.log("Clicked!");
}, 1000);

document.addEventListener("click", throttledClick);
```

> This will log "Clicked!" at most once per second, no matter how fast you click.
