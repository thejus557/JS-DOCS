## Currying with Placeholders

Sometimes we want to apply arguments in a different order or skip some arguments temporarily. Placeholder currying allows for this flexibility.

```javascript
// Define a placeholder symbol
const _ = Symbol('placeholder');

function curryWithPlaceholders(func) {
  return function curried(...args) {
    // Check if we have enough non-placeholder arguments
    const isComplete = args.length >= func.length && 
                      !args.slice(0, func.length).includes(_);
    
    if (isComplete) {
      return func(...args);
    }
    
    return function(...nextArgs) {
      // Replace placeholders with nextArgs values where applicable
      const newArgs = args.map(arg => 
        arg === _ && nextArgs.length ? nextArgs.shift() : arg
      );
      
      // Append any remaining nextArgs
      return curried(...newArgs, ...nextArgs);
    };
  };
}

// Example function to be curried
function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

// Applying the curryWithPlaceholders function
const curriedSum = curryWithPlaceholders(sum);

// Normal order: sum(5, 10, 15) = 30
console.log(curriedSum(5)(10)(15)); // 30

// Using placeholders to apply arguments in different order
console.log(curriedSum(_)(10)(5)(15)); // 30
console.log(curriedSum(_)(_)(15)(5)(10)); // 30
```

### Step-by-Step Execution for Placeholder Currying

Let's trace the execution of the placeholder currying with this example: `curriedSum(_)(10)(5)(15)`. This scenario applies the second argument first, then the first, then the third.

**Scenario**: We want to calculate the sum of 5, 10, and 15 using the placeholder curried sum function, but provide the arguments in a different order.

#### Log of Values:

1. **`const curriedSum = curryWithPlaceholders(sum);`**
   - The curryWithPlaceholders function is called with the sum function as input.
   - It returns the inner function curried.
   - curriedSum now refers to this curried function.

2. **`curriedSum(_)`**
   - The curried function is called with args = [_] (the placeholder).
   - The check for isComplete returns false because args.length (1) is less than func.length (3) and there's a placeholder.
   - The function returns a new function that will take the nextArgs.
   - **Log**: A new function is returned that will replace placeholders with actual arguments.

3. **`curriedSum(_)(10)`**
   - The returned function from the previous step is called with nextArgs = [10].
   - Inside this function:
     - newArgs is calculated as args.map(arg => arg === _ && nextArgs.length ? nextArgs.shift() : arg)
     - Since args = [_] and nextArgs = [10], nextArgs.shift() returns 10 and newArgs becomes [10]
     - curried(...newArgs, ...nextArgs) is called, which is curried(10)
   - The curried function checks isComplete again, which is still false.
   - Another function is returned.
   - **Log**: Another function is returned, with the state holding the value 10 in the first position.

4. **`curriedSum(_)(10)(5)`**
   - The function from the previous step is called with nextArgs = [5].
   - Inside this function:
     - args = [10] (no placeholders)
     - newArgs = [10] (unchanged)
     - curried(...newArgs, ...nextArgs) is called, which is curried(10, 5)
   - The curried function checks isComplete again, which is still false.
   - Another function is returned.
   - **Log**: Another function is returned, with the state holding the values 10 and 5.

5. **`curriedSum(_)(10)(5)(15)`**
   - The function from the previous step is called with nextArgs = [15].
   - Inside this function:
     - args = [10, 5] (no placeholders)
     - newArgs = [10, 5] (unchanged)
     - curried(...newArgs, ...nextArgs) is called, which is curried(10, 5, 15)
   - The curried function checks isComplete, which is now true since we have 3 arguments and no placeholders.
   - The original sum function is called with func(10, 5, 15).
   - The result of sum(10, 5, 15) (which is 30) is returned.
   - **Log**: The final result is 30.

This dry run demonstrates how the curryWithPlaceholders function allows us to apply arguments in different orders, providing more flexibility than traditional currying. In this case, we provided the arguments in the order: second argument, first argument, third argument, yet still got the correct result of 30.
