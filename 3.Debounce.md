# Debounce in JavaScript

## Definition

**Debouncing** is a programming technique used to ensure a function is not called too frequently. It delays the execution of a function until a specified amount of time has passed since the last time the function was invoked.

> Commonly used for optimizing performance-heavy operations triggered by rapid events like keystrokes, window resize, button clicks, or scrolls.

## Simple Debounce Implementation

```javascript
function debounce(fn, delay = 1000) {
  let timer;
  return function () {
    if (timer) clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(fn, delay);
  };
}
```

---

## Example Usage

```javascript
const sum = () => console.log('called');

const debouncedFn = debounce(sum);

// Simulate rapid calls
debouncedFn();
debouncedFn();

debouncedFn();
debouncedFn();

debouncedFn();
debouncedFn();

debouncedFn();
debouncedFn();
```

---

## Step-by-Step Execution

### What Happens:

1. `debouncedFn()` is called multiple times in rapid succession.
2. Each time it is called:
   - If a previous `timer` exists, it is cleared using `clearTimeout()`.
   - A new timeout is set using `setTimeout(fn, delay)`.
   - This postpones `fn` (i.e., `sum`) from being called until the `delay` period (1000ms) has passed **without** any further calls.

### Result:

- Since all the calls happen in quick succession (within less than 1000ms of each other), the function `sum()` is **never immediately executed**.
- Only the **last call** that was not followed by another call within 1000ms will allow `sum()` to finally execute.

## Visual Representation

| Call | Action                                 | Timer Reset? | Function Executed? |
|------|----------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| 1    | `debouncedFn()`                        | Yes          | No                  |
| 2    | `debouncedFn()` (quick succession)     | Yes          | No                  |
| ...  | ...                                    | Yes          | No                  |
| 8    | `debouncedFn()`                        | Yes          | After 1000ms        |

> So, only one `console.log('called')` will be printed â€” 1000ms after the **last** invocation.

## Use Cases

- **Search Box**: Avoid API calls on every keystroke
- **Resize Events**: Prevent continuous layout recalculations
- **Button Clicks**: Avoid rapid double/triple submissions
- **Scroll Events**: Optimize resource-heavy operations like animations or data loading

---

## Summary

This basic debounce function:

- Cancels the previous scheduled execution every time it's called again.
- Ensures the function `fn` is only executed **once**, after the last invocation **and** a delay period has passed.

```javascript
// Usage in real scenarios
window.addEventListener('resize', debounce(() => {
  console.log('Window resized!');
}, 500));
```
