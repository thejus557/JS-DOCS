# Throttling in JavaScript (with Leading and Trailing Options)

## Definition

**Throttling** is a technique used to limit how frequently a function can execute.  
It ensures that a function is executed at most once in a given time interval, no matter how many times it’s triggered.

This enhanced version supports:

- **Leading**: Immediately executes the function on the first call.
- **Trailing**: Ensures the last call in the interval is executed after the delay.

## Throttle Function with Leading and Trailing Options

```javascript
function throttle(fn, delay = 1000, options = { leading: true, trailing: true }) {
  let lastExecutedTime = 0;
  let timeout = null;
  let savedArgs = null;
  let savedContext = null;

  return function (...args) {
    const now = Date.now();

    if (lastExecutedTime === 0 && options.leading === false) {
      lastExecutedTime = now;
    }

    const timeRemaining = delay - (now - lastExecutedTime);

    savedArgs = args;
    savedContext = this;

    if (timeRemaining <= 0) {
      if (timeout) {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = null;
      }

      lastExecutedTime = now;
      fn.apply(savedContext, savedArgs);
    } else if (!timeout && options.trailing) {
      timeout = setTimeout(() => {
        lastExecutedTime = options.leading === false ? 0 : Date.now();
        timeout = null;
        fn.apply(savedContext, savedArgs);
      }, timeRemaining);
    }
  };
}
```

## Example Usage

```javascript
const log = () => console.log("Called at", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());

const throttledLog = throttle(log, 3000, { leading: true, trailing: true });

throttledLog(); // Executes immediately
throttledLog(); // Ignored
throttledLog(); // Ignored
// After 3s, one final "trailing" call happens
```

## Execution Flow

| Call # | Time Elapsed | Action        | Output        |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1      | 0ms           | `throttledLog()` | Executes immediately (`leading`) |
| 2–3    | <3000ms       | Called again    | Ignored       |
|       | +3000ms        | Timer fires     | Executes again (`trailing`) |

---

## Configurable Options

- **Leading only**: Executes the function at the **start** of the interval.

```javascript
throttle(fn, 1000, { leading: true, trailing: false });
```

- **Trailing only**: Executes the function at the **end** of the interval.

```javascript
throttle(fn, 1000, { leading: false, trailing: true });
```

- **Both leading and trailing**: Executes the function **at both the start and end** of the interval.

```javascript
throttle(fn, 1000, { leading: true, trailing: true });
```

---

## Summary

This throttling function gives you full control:

- `leading: true` → call function at the **start** of the interval
- `trailing: true` → call function at the **end** of the interval
- You can toggle both options as needed

```javascript
// Example with both leading and trailing
const throttledClick = throttle(() => {
  console.log("Clicked!");
}, 1000);

document.addEventListener("click", throttledClick);
```

> This will log "Clicked!" at most once every 1 second, logging both on the first click and after 1 second if no more clicks happen.
